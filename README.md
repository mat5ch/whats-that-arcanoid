## What's that, Arcanoid?

"What's that, Arcanoid?" is an audio-visual game about guessing a song title. As the title suggests, the game is based on the well-known classic game Arcanoid (also known as Breakout) and is similar to it in terms of graphics and game mechanics. Unlike Arcanoid, the game relies heavily on audio components to provide the player with a special experience.

The personal goal was to create a simple game in Max/MSP. I soon came to the conclusion that I could realize a modified version of Arcanoid. From the beginning, the guessing part was planned as the special feature of the game.
