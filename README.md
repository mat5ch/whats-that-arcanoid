## What's that, Arcanoid?

"What's that, Arcanoid?" is an audio-visual game about guessing a song title. As the title suggests, the game is based on the well-known classic game Arcanoid (also known as Breakout) and is similar to it in terms of graphics and game mechanics. Unlike Arcanoid, the game relies heavily on audio components to provide the player with a special experience.
